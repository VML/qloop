**QLoop** /'kyooâ€¢loop/ - *n* - Declarative asynchronous operation loops

## Introduction

**WIP** 

Enjoy some diagrams while things are still baking...

<br />


### Loops

Compose sequences of asynchronous operation `segments`,
then wrap them up into round-trip, *observable* loops.

### Segments

Operation segments are the vehicles that drive your
custom operations. Segments form a chain of operations,
each one's output linking to the previous one's input,
and so on.
